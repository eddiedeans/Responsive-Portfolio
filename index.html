            <p class="shrink">Hello, welcome to my portfolio webpage. My name is Eddie Borja. I've recently enrolled with 
                UCI Coding Bootcamp and so far its been exciting. Two weeks ago I didnt feel very comfortable 
                with HTML and CSS but its getting easier. My teachers are always great at explaining things and 
                make it fun to learn.
                <br>
                <br>
                There are two big reason why i joined this bootcamp. Firstly, I have alot of
                personal ideas for websites. I spend alot of time on the internet and always find my 
                self asking "why hasn't anyone created a website for that already". Secondly, working to 
                create amazing websites with a team that is likeminded excites me. Working as a team really helps 
                me learn new things.
